# DevOps @WWCDC
At a high level, "devops" refers to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. The word is literally "development" and "operations" combined together. Many more iterations exist of combining different elements like "security" into "devsecops".

See links below for resources about DevOps from the #devops channel on WWCDC slack.
