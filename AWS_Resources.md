## How can I study for AWS certs?
### 1. [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/)

#### Who has used this in Women who code DC?

@mmlumba

#### References:
@Palomanat: I used this for most of my Red Hat Certs and I love that they provide very deep content and labs where you don't have to setup your own "infrastructure" to study for a cert. I also used it for AWS CSA and I think it was a good resource because it trained for both the certification and build the confidence I needed to use AWS in a work setting.  
@mmlumba: I initially took this after taking an introductory AWS Developer Course. This helped me because it gave me a more in-depth look of the concepts I learned, quizzes that mimic actual AWS Developer Certification questions, and labs that let me practice either on their own virtual servers or on my own AWS infrastructure.

@palomanat

#### References:
@palomanat: Currently using this for AWS Developer. The classes are shorter than the ones on Linux Academy and since the AWS CSA and Developer overlap I think I can use a shortcut. 
### 4. [Certified Solutions Architect Official Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@palomanat
#### References:
@palomanat: I read the whole thing. It's the same as reading every FAQ on the AWS website. I would not recomend this unless you are a person that prefers reading vs video training.

### 3. [Whizlabs](https://whizlabs.com/)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@camclay
#### References:
@camclay: Have used it to pass 3 certifications in 2019, and its practice exams consistently align with the exam content. I have not purchased any of their courses. This site is also very affordable, $15-$30 per exam, and they often have sales if you sign up for their mailing list.

### 4. [Braincerts](https://braincerts.com/)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@camclay
#### References:
@camclay: Used their practice tests to pass the AWS Security Specialty. It's very detailed, and the questions felt harder than the actual exam. Higher cost than Whizlabs, but worth it as a backup if you're concerned with passing.
