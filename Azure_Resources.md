![AWS Certification Path Image](https://imgur.com/L10j0rq.png)

Foundational: 
* [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/training/path-cloudpractitioner/)
  * Certification is a general overview of most AWS Resources, and basic principles of cloud infrastructure, and AWS' IAAS (Infrastructure As A Service), PAAS (Platform As A Service), and SAAS (Software As A Service) solutions.

Associate:
* [AWS Developer Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/)
  * This will prepare you to develop cloud native solutions using AWS infrastucture and platforms, as well as provide insight and best practices for migrating legacy apps to the cloud.
* [AWS Solution Architect Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
  * This will prepare you to present cloud native solutions to clients, and dives deep into how AWS services can be integrated together to form complete applications and environments.
* [AWS SysOps Administration Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)
  * This will prepare you to operate an existing AWS environment, and deal with the challenges faced by maintaining highly available and fault tolerant applications.

Professional:
* [AWS DevOps Engineer Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/)
  * Next step from the Developer and SysOPs Associate, and will continue to dive further into developing solutions and managing them day to day. Covers using AWS tools to orchestrate Continuous  including AWS OpsWorks, and AWS CodePipeline.
* [AWS Solutions Architect Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/)
  * Next step from the Solutions Associate, and will prepare you to build the solutions you've presented to clients. This exam dives deep into the underlying technologies that make up many of AWS Managed solutions like Aurora.

Specialties - These exams slot in somewhere between the associate and professional level, and dig deep into specific technical domains.
* [Security](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/)
  * Prepares you to create secure AWS Organizations, and modify existing environments to have a better security footprint. Focuses also on monitoring and alerting, to deal with security incidents, and prevent them from happening in the first place.
* [Big Data](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-big-data-specialty/)
  * Prepares you to use AWS Big Data tools, and provide ETL, and reporting visualizations. This will cover in depth AWS Kinesis, RedShift, Athena, Hadoop and other solutions.
* [Advanced Networking](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/)
  * Dives deep into building performant network architectures, leveraging AWS Direct COnnect and PrivateLink to connect On-Premise data centers and AWS endpoints. Would recommend taking this if you already have experience with Networking, either Network+, or Cisco Certifications, as well as AWS Solution Architect or SysOps certification.
* [Alexa SKill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/)
  * Dives into building Alexa skills, to integrate Alexa into your existing apps, and build and design new apps around Alexa.
* [Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/)
  * Provides training on how to use AI and Machine Learning solutions inside of AWS. Focuses on Data Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modeling of Data, and implementing Machine Learning Operations.
  
## How can I study for AWS certs?
### 1. [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/)

#### Who has used this in Women who code DC?
@palomanat 
@mmlumba

#### References:
@Palomanat: I used this for most of my Red Hat Certs and I love that they provide very deep content and labs where you don't have to setup your own "infrastructure" to study for a cert. I also used it for AWS CSA and I think it was a good resource because it trained for both the certification and build the confidence I needed to use AWS in a work setting.  
@mmlumba: I initially took this after taking an introductory AWS Developer Course. This helped me because it gave me a more in-depth look of the concepts I learned, quizzes that mimic actual AWS Developer Certification questions, and labs that let me practice either on their own virtual servers or on my own AWS infrastructure.

### 2. [acloud.guru](https://acloud.guru/)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@palomanat

#### References:
@palomanat: Currently using this for AWS Developer. The classes are shorter than the ones on Linux Academy and since the AWS CSA and Developer overlap I think I can use a shortcut. 
### 4. [Certified Solutions Architect Official Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@palomanat
#### References:
@palomanat: I read the whole thing. It's the same as reading every FAQ on the AWS website. I would not recomend this unless you are a person that prefers reading vs video training.

### 3. [Whizlabs](https://whizlabs.com/)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@camclay
#### References:
@camclay: Have used it to pass 3 certifications in 2019, and its practice exams consistently align with the exam content. I have not purchased any of their courses. This site is also very affordable, $15-$30 per exam, and they often have sales if you sign up for their mailing list.

### 4. [Braincerts](https://braincerts.com/)
#### Who has used this in Women Who Code DC?
@camclay
#### References:
@camclay: Used their practice tests to pass the AWS Security Specialty. It's very detailed, and the questions felt harder than the actual exam. Higher cost than Whizlabs, but worth it as a backup if you're concerned with passing.
